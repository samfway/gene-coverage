# Notes about the test set small_*
# small_contig.coords contains several, hand-crafted contig alignments
# small_contig_genes.gff contains several, hand-crafted contig annotations

# Notes for the genes in small_contig_genes.gff: 
ID=1 :  Exact match. 
     :  Start is at 20000
     :  Length is 500bp (20000, 20499) 
    
ID=2 :  Exact match.  Minus strand (500bp)
     :  Start is at 20000
     :  Length is 500bp (20000, 20499) 

ID=3 :  Gene is shorter than contig by 100bp.  (400bp)
     :  Start is at 20000
     :  Length is 400bp (20000, 20399)

ID=4 :  Gene starts near the end of the alignment, at 501.
     :  Overlap is then between 501 and 600
     :  Start is at 20400
     :  Length is 100bp (20400, 20499)  

ID=5 :  Gene starts before the alignment.
     :  Overlap is between 101 and 200
     :  Length is 100bp (20000, 20099) 

ID=6 :  Gene is larger than the alignment. 
     :  Overlap is just the contig boundary 
     :  Length is 500bp (20000, 20499)

ID=7 :  Gene is in the middle of the alignment.
     :  Overlap is just the gene boundary (100bp)
     :  Length is 100bp (20100, 20199)

ID=8 :  No overlap.  Not in the ouptut file
