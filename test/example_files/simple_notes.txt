# Overlap information for simple_predicted.gff and simple_actual.gff
#--------------------------------------------------------------------

First gene (1-3):
+ Overlaps first contig (2-3) from (2-3), so coverage is two-thirds.

Second gene(50-100):
+ Overlaps second contig from 75-100, so coverage is 26/51 (0.50980392)

Third gene(201-250):
+ Overlaps third from 240-250, so coverage is 11/50 (0.22)

Fourth gene(1001-1300):
+ Overlap fourth contig from 1001-1200, so coverage is 200/300 

Fifth gene(1201-1400):
+ Overlap from 1201-1300, coverage is 100/200 or one half. 

Sixth gene(3201-3400):
+ No overlap, coverage is 0.
